<br><br>
            &bull; Daisy will present a minimum of $1,000 on a prepaid credit card to every BB gun team that qualifies for, attends and competes at the Daisy Nationals in 2016. This money can be used for travel costs and equipment and will enable some teams to attend and compete who otherwise could not.
            <br><br>
            &bull; Consecutive Match Exclusion: Individuals who fire as regular members of a team competing in the DNBBGCM are precluded from firing as a regular team member at the State and/or DNBBGCM the following year. This rule assures that new shooters will get a chance to compete.
            <br><br>
            &bull; The BB match is an NRA sanctioned match.
            <br><br>
            &bull; There is also a Champions Match that is open to contestants from last year who do not qualify to shoot at DNBBGCM because of the rule on shooting in consecutive matches. It is open to any shooter from previous year who meets the age rules for DNBBGCM.

            &bull; DNBBGCM Team: If a sponsoring organization has more than one team fire in a State Championship and one of their teams earns an invitation to the DNBBGCM, the sponsoring organization may select shooters from any of their teams in the State Championship to make up the team representing the organization at the DNBBGCM. Only those shooters who have fired in a State Championship may be selected to represent an organization at the DNBBGCM. A shooter must represent the same organization in both the State Championship and the DNBBGCM. The names of each shooter on an DNBBGCM team must appear on a State Championship results bulletin representing the same sponsoring organization; no pickup teams are allowed at the DNBBGCM.
